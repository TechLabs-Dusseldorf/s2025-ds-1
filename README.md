# **Global Electricity Production**

**Team:** Group 1 (TechLabs Düsseldorf – Spring 2025)
**Dataset:** Global Electricity Production (Kaggle)

## **Scenario:** Commissioned by the Global Energy Alliance (GEA) to provide insights for their annual Global Energy Outlook.

## **Project Overview**

The Global Energy Alliance (GEA) asked to analyze historical electricity production data across countries and energy sources. The goal is to identify global trends, top producers, the energy mix, and renewable growth to guide sustainable energy policies and enhance energy security.

Our work turns raw CSV data into policy-relevant insights using Python.

## **Tech Stack**
Language: Python 3.11.7
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib
Visualization / Presentation: Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit*, PowerPoint
Collaboration: GitHub

## **Key Findings (Beginner Phase)**
Global Production Trend: +9% growth from 2010 (~40.5M GWh) to 2023 (~44.1M GWh).
Balance Categories: Net Production dominates (6.77×10⁸ GWh); imports/exports are small but relevant for energy security.
Top Producers: USA, China, Japan, India, Canada → nearly half of global production.
Dominant Sources: Electricity, Combustible Fuels, Coal/Peat still dominate, but their shares are slowly declining.
Renewables Growth:
Total Renewables: 1.96M GWh (2010) → 7.67M GWh (2023), nearly 4× increase.
Hydro = largest renewable (37.2M GWh total).
Wind (14.9M GWh) & Solar (6.8M GWh) are fastest-growing.

## **Next Steps (Intermediate / Advanced)**
Renewable growth rate analysis by country (YoY %).
Country-specific energy mix shifts (e.g., developed vs developing).
Fossil fuel dependence vs renewable integration trends.
Seasonal patterns (Hydro in Norway, Solar in Australia, etc.).
