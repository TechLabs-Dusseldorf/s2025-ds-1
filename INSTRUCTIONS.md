# Welcome Group1 to your project phase

## The scenario: Global electricity production
Your team has been approached by the Global Energy Alliance (GEA), an international non-profit organization focused on promoting sustainable energy policies and fostering energy security worldwide.
The GEA is preparing its annual 'Global Energy Outlook' report and is particularly interested in understanding the evolving landscape of electricity production across different countries and energy sources. They need data-driven insights to inform their policy recommendations, identify countries making significant strides in renewable energy, and pinpoint areas requiring more investment or policy intervention.

## The task
Your task is to leverage historical electricity production data to provide the GEA with a comprehensive analytical brief. They are particularly keen on understanding trends, country-specific performance, and the changing mix of energy sources. Your findings will be presented to a panel of GEA policymakers and energy economists.

- Document all your steps and thoughts, so the mentors can follow your process
- Prepare a nice README.md for your project
- Think about how you can present your results for different target groups

## Some guidance (optional, if needed)
Your analysis can address the following questions, categorized by complexity.
If you want to add or do others, feel free to do so. 
If you can find additional data that suits your original dataset, feel free to implement it.

### Beginner Questions
- Data Loading and Initial Exploration:
    - Display the first 5 rows and check the data types of each column.
    - Identify and handle any missing values.
- Overall Production Trends:
    - What is the total global electricity production (across all countries and products) for each year in the dataset? Visualize this trend over time.
    - Which balance categories (e.g., "Production", "Imports") are present in the dataset, and what are their respective total values?
- Top Producers (Overall):
    - Which 5 countries have the highest total electricity production across all years and all energy sources?
    - What is the average monthly electricity production for each of these top 5 countries?
- Dominant Energy Sources:
    - Globally, which are the top 3 most common product (energy sources) in terms of total value produced over the entire period?
    - How has the global share of these top 3 energy sources changed year-on-year? (e.g., percentage contribution to total production).
- Introduction to Renewables:
    - What is the total value of "Total Renewables" produced globally each year?
    - Which renewable energy sources (product) are explicitly listed in the dataset (e.g., "Solar", "Wind", "Hydro")? Calculate their individual total production over the entire period.
### Intermediate Questions
- Renewable Energy Growth Analysis:
    - For the top 5 countries (in terms of overall production), analyze the growth rate of "Total Renewables" production year-over-year. Which country shows the most significant growth in renewable energy?
    - Visualize the yearly production of "Solar" and "Wind" energy for these top 5 countries over time.
- Country-Specific Energy Mix Shift:
    - Select two diverse countries (e.g., one developed, one developing, or one with high renewables vs. one with high fossil fuels from your initial exploration).
    - For each selected country, analyze and visualize the proportion of electricity generated from different product types (e.g., Coal, Natural Gas, Hydro, Solar, Wind) for the years 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2023. Describe any observed shifts in their energy mix.
- Fossil Fuel Dependence vs. Renewable Integration:
    - Identify countries that have a high dependence on fossil fuels (e.g., Coal, Natural Gas, Oil) and analyze their trend of fossil fuel usage versus renewable energy integration (Total Renewables) over time.
    - Can you find any countries that have significantly reduced their fossil fuel reliance while increasing renewable production? Quantify this change.
- Seasonal Patterns (Optional/Advanced):
    - Choose a specific country and a specific energy source (e.g., "Hydro" in Norway, or "Solar" in Australia). Analyze if there are any clear seasonal patterns in their monthly electricity production.
    - Visualize these patterns if they exist.
### Policy Implications & Recommendations (Qualitative):
- Based on your findings, what are 2-3 key insights you would highlight to the Global Energy Alliance regarding global electricity production trends?
- Suggest a potential policy recommendation for a country or region based on your data analysis that could further promote sustainable energy or enhance energy security.

Remember to provide clear visualizations and concise explanations for all your findings. Good luck, and may your insights power a greener future!
